# Three Panes

Based on an accident when I had the morphic nav interior (lighter colored) be wider than its outer counterpart.

It made it look 3 dimensional.

This made me think that if the lightest pane was always for navigation, the pane underneat can always be fore the main content. A third pane can always be for extra features that are not needed but assist the second pane.

The panes can move about the screen as then need to represent any content.
